DMS is a module for creating, managing and viewing document files directly
within Odoo.
This module is only the basis for an entire ecosystem of apps that extend and
seamlessly integrate with the document management system.

This module adds portal functionality for directories and files for allowed users, both portal or internal users. You can get as well a tokenized link from a directory or a file for sharing it with any anonymous user.

Installation
============

Preview
~~~~~~~

`mail_preview_base` is required for DMS but it is recommended to install all
the other `mail_preview` modules from `social` OCA repository
in order to improve the preview of files.

`python-magic` library is recommended to be installed for having whole support
to get proper file types and file preview.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Documents -> Configuration -> Storages*.
#. Create a new document storage. You can choose between two options on `Save Type`:
    * `Database`: Store the files on the database as a field
    * `Attachment`: Store the files as attachments
#. Afterwards go to *Documents -> Directories*.
#. Create a new directory, mark it as root and select the previously created setting.
#. On the Directory you can also define the access groups that will be able to:
    * read
    * create
    * write
    * delete


Migration
~~~~~~~~~

If you need to modify the storage Save Type you might want to migrate the file data.
In order to achieve it you need to:

#. Go to *Documents -> Configuration -> Storage* and select the storage you want to modify
#. Modify the save type
#. Press the button `Migrate files` if you want to migrate all the files at once
#. Press the button `Manual File Migration` in order to specify files one by one

You can check all the files that still needs to be migrated from all storages
and migrate them manually on *Documents -> Configuration -> Migration*

Usage
=====

The best way to manage the documents is to switch to the Documents view.
Existing documents can be managed there and new documents can be created.

Portal functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add any portal user to DMS access groups, and then allow that group in directories, so they will see in the portal such directories and their files.
Another possibility is to click on "Share" button inside a directory or a file for obtaining a tokenized link for single access to that resource, no matter if logged or not.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Files preview in portal
- Allow to download folder in portal and create zip file with all content
- Save in cache own_root directories and update in every create/write/unlink function
- Add a migration procedure for converting an storage to attachment one for populating existing records with attachments as folders
- Add a link from attachment view in chatter to linked documents
- If Inherit permissions from related record (the inherit_access_from_parent_record field from storage) is changed when directories already exist, inconsistencies may occur because groups defined in the directories and subdirectories will still exist, all groups in these directories should be removed before changing.
- Since portal users can read ``dms.storage`` records, if your module extends this model to another storage backend that needs using secrets, remember to forbid access to the secrets fields by other means. It would be nice to be able to remove that rule at some point.
