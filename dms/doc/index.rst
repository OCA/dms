MuK Document Management System
==============================

MuK Documents is a module to create, manage and view files directly within Odoo.
In addition to views for files and folders, it offers its own all in one view
to make working with documents easier. This module is only the basis for an 
entire ecosystem of apps that extend and seamlessly integrate with the document
management system.

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to:

Download the module and add it to your Odoo addons folder. Afterward, log on to
your Odoo server and go to the Apps menu. Trigger the debug modus and update the
list by clicking on the "Update Apps List" link. Now install the module by
clicking on the install button.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Documents -> Configuration -> Settings*.
#. Create a new document setting.
#. Afterwards go to *Documents -> Data -> Directories*.
#. Create a new directory, mark it as root and select the previously created setting.

Usage
=============

The best way to manage the documents is to switch to the Documents view. Existing
documents can be managed there and new documents can be created.
